# ðŸŽ§ Vibe-Based Playlist Generator

*A Shiny App for Discovering Songs with a Similar Vibe*

## Purpose & Features

**Vibe-Based Playlist Generator** is an R package and Shiny web app that lets users explore songs based on their audio characteristics.

It uses a locally stored dataset of tracks and computes similarity between songs using their audio "vibe" â€” things like **energy**, **valence**, and **danceability**.

The app helps users find songs that *feel* like a song they already love â€” without relying on external APIs like Spotify.
